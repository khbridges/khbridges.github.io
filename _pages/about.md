I am a PhD candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Yale University. I work with [Kathryn Miller-Jensen](https://www.miller-jensen.org) on various topics in computational systems immunology and single-cell data analysis. I am particularly interested in using data-driven approaches to understand how tumors hijack homeostatic cell-cell communication and how these signaling network can be course-corrected with combinatorial immunotherapies.
